# Movie Poster Cards
I have created a movie poster card using HTML, CSS. The goal of this project is to develop a movie poster card that displays several movies on the screen such as movie title, rating, movie cast and some details about the movie.

Movie poster card should have the following features:

Image: I have chosen a high-quality image that captures the    essence of the movie. Consider using a scene from the movie, a character portrait, or a symbolic image.

Title: Use a large, bold font that is easy to read and stands out. The title should be placed prominently on the card.

Tagline: A tagline is a short, catchy phrase that summarizes the movie's plot or theme. Place the tagline below the title, in a smaller font.

Release date: The release date is included in small, neutral font on the card.

Layout: The layout of the card is balanced and visually appealing. The card is not cluttered with too much text or imagery.

Responsive Design:  Movie poster card is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

Testing: This website ensures that it works correctly in different browsers and devices and looks good everywhere.

Code Quality: Code Quality is the clean, organized, and well-documented.
